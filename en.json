    "rama9": "The Royal Initiative to Create Phutthamonthon King Rama IX recognized that Buddhism is a source for building morality and ethics in society, and it serves as a center for studying the teachings of the Buddha. He believed that the creation of Phutthamonthon would help Buddhism flourish in Thailand and place an emphasis on the practice of Dharma in an open and inclusive way. His Majesty also wished for Phutthamonthon to be a place where everyone could pay respects to the great Buddha statue, practice meditation, and study the teachings of the Buddha in a peaceful atmosphere. The goal was to foster inner peace and create a place for people to engage in spiritual practice together.\n\nThe Creation of Phutthamonthon The design of Phutthamonthon incorporates elements that reflect the teachings of Buddhism, such as the stupa (chedi), a large Buddha statue, a pond symbolizing purity, and gardens that create a tranquil environment suitable for meditation. There is also a pilgrimage path, allowing people to visit various locations that embody the principles of Buddhism. The establishment of Phutthamonthon is thus an essential part of promoting Buddhism in Thailand, and it reflects His Majestyâ€™s remarkable insight in creating a space that promotes learning and the practice of Dharma for the benefit of all citizens."
